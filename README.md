<h1>My Weather App Project</h1>
<h3>What is the project?</h3>
<p>I am a student attending the Nucamp Frontend Bootcamp. For my bootcamp we needed to create a react project and I was initially at a loss. After some thought I decided to remake a prokect I had originally made as a vanilla javscript project.</p>
<h3>What Technologies were used?</h3>
<p>I used a couple different libraries to create my project.</p>
<ul><li><h4>React</h4><p>This one is obvious!  I used React to as the backbone of my project. I used a lot of features in React including State, Props, Functional and Class Components, amongst others</p></li>
<li><h4>WeatherAPI/h4><p>To gather local weather data I used WeatherAPI to fetch data for the area the user is located in.</p></li>
<li><h4>Reactstrap</h4><p>To space properly and consistently I used Reactstrap to provide even responisve spacing</p></li></ul>
